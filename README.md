# Voxel grid k-nearest-neighbor queries in PyTorch

This is an inoffical implementation of the voxel grid datastructure for k-nearest-neighbor queries presented in [Xu et al. Point-NeRF: Point-based Neural Radiance Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.08845).

In comparison to the original implementation, it is:
- standalone
- implemented as a PyTorch module instead of using pycuda
